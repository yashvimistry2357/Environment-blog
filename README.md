Waste Management is a process of collecting, transporting, treating and disposing waste materials
What is the Big Deal with Waste?
Did you know that most of our trash goes to a place called a landfill? It’s basically a giant hole in the ground filled with garbage. The problem is, landfills are running out of space, and they can smell really bad and hurt the soil.
If we manage our waste better, we can keep our neighborhoods clean and save animals from getting stuck in our plastic.

The 5 R's: My Secret Formula
You’ve probably heard of the 3 R's, but my teacher taught us five! Here they are in order of importance:
Refuse: Just say "No, thank you!" to things you don't need, like plastic straws at a restaurant or those free plastic toys that break in five minutes.
Reduce: Use less stuff. For example, try to use both sides of your paper when you're drawing.
Reuse: Before you throw something away, ask: "Can I use this again?" I use old glass jam jars to hold my colored pencils!
Repurpose (Upcycle): This is the fun part. It’s like a craft project! You can turn an old T-shirt into a reusable grocery bag or a plastic bottle into a bird feeder.
Recycle: If you can't do the first four, make sure you put your paper, glass, and metal in the recycling bin so they can be made into something new.

My "Waste-Free" Challenge
I tried something new this week. Usually, my lunch has plastic wrap and juice boxes. But this week, I used:
A reusable lunch box (no plastic bags!)
A metal water bottle
A cloth napkin instead of paper tissues

What’s Your Idea?
I want to know—have you ever made something cool out of "trash"? Last month, I made a robot out of cereal boxes!!
